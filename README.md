Hello this is a project from my boot camp Cyber4s. In this project I wrote a CURD app where the soviot are storing nuclear socks (Please don't take it seriously).

It uses: React.js, SCSS, Jest and react router, Express Posgress for DB. Because Heroku is not longer free You might not be able to run the backend.

P.S: I hate styling stuff. :)
